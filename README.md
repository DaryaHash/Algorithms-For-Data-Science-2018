## Class time, Location and Examinations:
Saturday and Monday 08:00-09:30 AM (Fall 2018), Room 206. 

### Two written exams:
Midterm Examination: Saturday 1397/09/10, 08:00-10:00 <br>
Final Examination:

## Grading:
* Homework – 15% <br>
— Will consist of mathematical problems and/or programming assignments.
* Midterm – 35%
* Endterm – 50%

## Prerequisites:
General mathematical sophistication; and a solid understanding of Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory, at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level, or equivalent.

## Topics:
Have a look at some reports of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or Stanford students ([CS224N](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/), [CS224D](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html)) to get some general inspiration.

## Account:
It is necessary to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to share your projects. It offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts. Github is like the hammer in your toolbox, therefore, you need to have it!

## Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are vital elements of the academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group's).

## Questions?
I'll be having office hours for this course on Saturday and Monday (09:30 AM--12:00 AM). If this isn't convenient, email me at hhaji@sbu.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
