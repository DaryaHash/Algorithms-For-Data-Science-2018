Course: Algorithms for Data Science <br>
[Data Science Center](http://ds.sbu.ac.ir)<br> 
[Shahid Beheshti University](http://www.sbu.ac.ir/)

## Main TextBooks:
* [Data Mining and Analysis: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms](http://www.dataminingbook.info/pmwiki.php/Main/BookResources) by Mohammed J. Zaki and Wagner Meira Jr.
* [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/handouts.html) by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeff Ullman.

## Class time, Location and Examinations:
Saturday and Monday 08:00-09:30 AM (Fall 2018), Room 206. 

### Two written exams:
Midterm Examination: Saturday 1397/09/10, 08:00-10:00
Final Examination:

## Grading:
* Homework – 15% <br>
— Will consist of mathematical problems and/or programming assignments.
* Midterm – 35%
* Endterm – 50%

## Prerequisites:
General mathematical sophistication; and a solid understanding of Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory, at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level, or equivalent.

## Topics:
Have a look at some reports of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or Stanford students ([CS224N](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/), [CS224D](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html)) to get some general inspiration.

## Account:
It is necessary to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to share your projects. It offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts. Github is like the hammer in your toolbox, therefore, you need to have it!

## Coding:
You may also find it helpful to read Python and its wonderful libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), but note that in this course it’s really not necessary to know Python. Instead, just use one of the following softwares to figure things out along the way.

* [Orange](http://orange.biolab.si/), open source data analytics and mining through visual programming or Python scripting. Components for visualization, rule learning, clustering, model evaluation, and more.
* [RapidMiner](http://rapidminer.com/), makes data science teams more productive through a unified platform for data prep, machine learning, and model deployment.
* [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html), collection of machine learning algorithms for solving real-world data mining problems. It is written in Java and runs on almost any platform.

To know more softwares, refer to the following webpage of [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/index.html):

## Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are vital elements of the academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group's).

## Questions?
I'll be having office hours for this course on Saturday and Monday (09:30 AM--12:00 AM). If this isn't convenient, email me at hhaji@sbu.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
