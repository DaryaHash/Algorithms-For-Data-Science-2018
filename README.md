# [Algorithms For Data Science (Fall 2018)](http://facultymembers.sbu.ac.ir/hhaji/algorithms-for-data-science/)
Course: Algorithms for Data Science <\br>
Place: [Applied and Industrial Mathematics Group](http://www.sbu.ac.ir/Cols/mathsci/Pages/گروه-ریاضی-کاربردی-و-صنعتی.aspx), [Shahid Beheshti University](http://www.sbu.ac.ir/)

## Main TextBooks:
* [Data Mining and Analysis: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms](http://www.dataminingbook.info/pmwiki.php/Main/BookResources) by Mohammed J. Zaki and Wagner Meira Jr.
* [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/handouts.html) by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeff Ullman.

## Class time, Location and Examinations:
Saturday and Monday 08:00-10:00 AM (Fall 2018), Room 206. 

### Two written exams:
Midterm Examination: Saturday 1397/09/10, 08:00-10:00

## Grading:
* Homework – 15%

— Will consist of mathematical problems and/or programming assignments.
* Midterm – 35%
* Endterm – 50%

## Prerequisites:
General mathematical sophistication; and a solid understanding of Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory, at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level, or equivalent.

## Course Project Resources:
Several programming assignments that cover the topic of the course. Students individually implement given assignments in recommended language or tool, and periodically demonstrate the progress to teaching assistants. The following resources may be helpful for those still undecided about their course project.

## Datasets:
* DataHub has a lot of structured data in formats such as RDF and CSV. 
* UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
* CrowdFlower Data for Everyone library
* Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection

To know more datasets, refer to the following webpage of KDnuggets:
* Datasets for Data Mining and Data Science

## Topics:
Have a look at some reports of Kaggle or Stanford students (CS224N, CS224D) to get some general inspiration.

## Account:
It is necessary to have a GitHub account to share your projects. It offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts. 

## Coding:
You may also find it helpful to read Python and its wonderful libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), but note that in this course it’s really not necessary to know Python. Instead, just use one of the following softwares to figure things out along the way.

* Orange, open source data analytics and mining through visual programming or Python scripting. Components for visualization, rule learning, clustering, model evaluation, and more.
* RapidMiner, makes data science teams more productive through a unified platform for data prep, machine learning, and model deployment.
* Weka, collection of machine learning algorithms for solving real-world data mining problems. It is written in Java and runs on almost any platform.

To know more softwares, refer to the following webpage of KDnuggets:

* Software Suites/Platforms for Analytics, Data Mining, Data Science, and Machine Learning
Python:

You can learn python via SoloLearn (A great website for getting started with coding. It offers easy to follow lessons, interspersed with quizzes to help you retain what you are learning). Also, we recommend the following references: 

* Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Second  Edition, by Allen B. Downey (free PDF book)
* How to Think Like a Computer Scientist by Brad Miller and David Ranum
* Python for Everybody by Charles R. Severance (free PDF book)
* Practical Programming (2nd edition): An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3 by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, and Jason Montojo, 2013.
* The Python Tutorial (available from the Python website)

If you want practice Python more, then we recommend to solve the problems of Project Euler!

## Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are the vital elements of academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group’s).

## Questions?
I’ll be having office hours for this course on Monday 10:00 AM–12:00 AM. If this isn’t convenient, email me at hhaji@sbu.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
