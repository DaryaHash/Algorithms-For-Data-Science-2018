## Programming Language 
You can learn python via [SoloLearn](http://www.sololearn.com/) (A great website for getting started with coding. It offers easy to follow lessons, interspersed with quizzes to help you retain what you are learning). Also, we recommend the following references: 

* [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/), Second  Edition, by Allen B. Downey (free PDF book)
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html) by Brad Miller and David Ranum
* [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book.php) by Charles R. Severance (free PDF book)
* [Practical Programming (2nd edition): An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3](https://pragprog.com/book/gwpy2/practical-programming) by Paul Gries, Jennifer Campbell, and Jason Montojo, 2013.
* The Python Tutorial ([available from the Python website](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/))

If you want practice Python more, then we recommend to solve the problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)!
